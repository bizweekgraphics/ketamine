  <h1>KETAMINE TO THE RESCUE</h1>

<article>

 <div id="inner" class="center">



<p class="intro">Dennis Hartman had already scheduled his suicide when he decided to try the drug ketamine for the first time. At 46, he’d excelled professionally, working his way up the ranks as a management consultant at Arthur Anderson and Deloitte before going on to become chief executive of a thriving gaming company. All the while he’d masked his unshakable depression. “I became a good actor,” he says. “I never revealed to anyone the degree of my childhood abuse or my dysfunction.” </p>

<p>Then life became unbearable. Antidepressants stopped working; in fact they seemed to make everything worse. “I decided ending my life was the most humane thing to do,” Hartman says. “I set the date a couple months into the future so a couple young family members could finish the school year before I traumatized them badly.”</p>

<p>In Tkmonth of 2011CK, while waiting to kill himself, Hartman discovered online that the National Institutes of Health were enrolling treatment-resistant patients in a study on ketamine. The drug, a generic anesthetic, had been shown to lift severe depression, often in a matter of just hours. “In the middle of the night I sent them an email,” recalls Hartman. Days later, he found himself in a hospital hooked up to an intravenous ketamine drip. “It was the moment of my life,” he says. “Within a few hours I could tell that my anxiety and depression were completely gone for the first time in my memory.”</p>

<p>After the study, Hartman dropped everything and began promoting ketamine. He also launched the Ketamine Advocacy Network to help others locate a handful of doctors who’d opened ketamine clinics to offer the experimental treatment.</p>
h
<p>Four years later, ketamine still hasn’t been approved as an antidepressant therapy but doctors are increasingly taking advantage of the fact that they can legally administer and prescribe the anesthesia drug off label. “I personally know of 30 clinics or solo practices offering ketamine infusions,” says Hartman. “I estimate that there are at least 20 more…who do not advertise.” At least two physicians are forging plans to expand into a dozen or more locations within the next couple years. Meanwhile, clinics can barely keep up with demand from desperate patients who pay anywhere from $300 to $1000 for each 45-minute infusion. </p>

<p>Ketamine, a synthetic drug developed in 1962, has long been used in operating rooms as a general anesthetic for both humans and animals. Doctors also administer infusions for post-operative and neuropathic pain. Because subanesthetic doses can induce hallucinations and out-of-body experiences, ketamine became popular, starting in the 70’s, as a recreational drug for New Age spiritualists and partiers alike. Informally it became known as Special K, or Vitamin K, and was said to put some users in a trace-like “k-hole,” making it difficult for them to move and see. In 1999, America banned non-medical use, designating ketamine a schedule III controlled substance, meaning that it has moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. </p>

<p>That same yearCK, Yale researchers stumbled upon the drug’s promise as a mood stabilizer. They’d set out to study depression as affected by glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved with brain function, including memory, learning, and emotion. To do so, they exposed seven clinically depressed subjects to ketamine, which is known to blockCK glutamate receptors in the brain. “We were not thinking at the time that ketamine would be an antidepressant,” says Dennis Charney, one of the scientists, who is now dean of Mt Sinai’s School of Medicine in Manhattan. “When patients started telling us they were better…we’d ask, Are you sure?!”</p>

<p>The group’s findings, published in the Biological Psychiatry journal, were met with silence. The study was tiny and, “because ketamine had been abused, people were reluctant [to perform follow-up tests],” says Charney. “And they didn’t believe you could get better from depression in a few hours—they’d never seen that before.” After all, standard antidepressants like Prozac and Wellbutrin, take weeks if not months to kick in, and frequently don’t work at all.  </p>

<p>Six years after the initial findings, Charney, who’d gone on to work for the National Institutes of Health, instigated a replica study using 17 patients. “This was a population that had failed on average six different anti-depressants and some had also failed electro convulsive therapy, which is generally regarded as a treatment of last resort,” says Husseini Mangi, one of Charney’s co-authors, who is now global head of neuroscience for Johnson & Johnson. The results concluded that more than 70 percent of test subjects went into remission within 24 hours following their ketamine infusion. Since then, scientists have performed dozens more studies that confirmed the drug’s impact.</p>

<p>Speedy results aside, the science of ketamine is unlike commonly prescribed antidepressants. A single dose tends to relieve depression long after the drug has left the patient’s system—sometimes for as long as week or month, sometimes for more than a year. This is likely because ketamine causes lasting physical changes in the brain, reversing neural damage caused by stress and depression by helping to regenerate atrophied neurons. The drug has also been shown to decrease inflammation, help control cortisol levels, and likely interacts with other biological mechanisms involved in mood regulation. </p>

<p>So why hasn’t ketamine been fast-tracked for Food and Drug Administration approval? The big problem, ketamine advocates say, is that pharmaceutical companies, which usually foot the bill for clinical trials, can’t make money off a decades-old generic drug. Instead, companies like Johnson & Johnson are spending millions to create analogues and derivatives of ketamine that can be patented to generate blockbuster sales. </p>

<p>While big pharma searches for a lucrative ketamine-like product, thousands of suicidal and depressed people are flocking to private ketamine clinics for treatment. The doctors follow existing research protocols when possible. They typically administer six infusions in a course of two weeks, then have patients return for maintenance infusions when necessary. During each treatment, patients are given less than a fifth of the dose they’d get for anesthesia, and it’s administered over the course of 45 minutes rather than all at once. Vitals are carefully monitored throughout. </p>

<p>Steven Levine, an energetic 37-year-old psychiatrist based in Princeton, New Jersey, was probably the first to take the leap and start a ketamine infusion business back in 2011. “When I read the studies, they blew my mind, they almost spun my head around,” he recalls. “I got to the point where I decided, I need to start using this even if other people aren’t--I can’t talk myself out of it, it makes too much sense.” </p>

<img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3652/3320220662_db9ca69112_b.jpg">

<p>After exhaustively researching ketamine and consulting anesthesiologist about safety and dosing, Levine convinced a local hospital to give him space and assistance to start administering the drug intravenously. “At first, I was so nervous, I’d sit across from the patients during their infusions and constantly ask, ‘Are you okay? Are you okay?’” he says. “Luckily I caught on pretty quickly that I was making them uncomfortable.” </p> 

<p>Soon, Levine realized he needed his own clinic in order to tinker with and perfect his protocol outside the confines of hospital bureaucracy. He also says it’s important for patients to experience ketamine in a peaceful environment, especially because the drug can induce mild hallucination. In March, Levine opened the Ketamine Treatment Centers of Princeton in a medical office building located five minutes outside Princeton by car. The walls are hung with abstract artworks painted by a local psychotherapist. During infusions, which are administered by a former oncology nurse, Levine encourages patietns to listen to relaxing music of their choice. </p>

<p>Under the influence report, many experience strange sensations, like seeing colors and patterns when they close their eyes. “The first time I had sense that the chair was rocketing upwards, just on and on and on…a kind of weightlessness,” one patient explained on a recent Friday. The 51-year-old environmental engineer and university lecturer, who prefers to remain anonymous for professional reasons, credits ketamine with reviving him from a near-catatonic depression that left him unable to look even his wife and children in the eyes. “During the treatment, I got this profound feeling of optimism,” he says. “I told my family it’s like getting hit by the freight train of happiness—they tease me about that now.” </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies tend to categorize the dissociative effect of ketamine as an unwanted side effect, but Levine—along with many other researchers exploring the promise of psychedelics in battling depression--argues that the hallucinations are likely harmless, and may even be helpful. “Ultimately, it’s a dreamlike experience,” he says. “We don’t tell people not to sleep because they might dream.” A recent study at U.C. Berkeley, he points out, found that experiencing positive emotions, specifically awe, has an anti-inflammatory effect. Later this year, Levine plans to launch a similar study to evaluate whether patients who experience a stronger dissociative effect during ketamine infusions have better outcomes.  </p>

<p>Over the past four years, Levine says he’s treated roughly 400 patients. He still keeps up a regular psychiatry practice in a second office, but sees about 35 ketamine patients per week. Since insurance generally doesn’t cover infusions, for which he charges $400, he instead bills them for an extended psychiatric visit. “I’m talking with the patients, prescribing medicines, and doing a lot more than the infusions,” he explains.  In terms of income, Levine says his ketamine business is at least as lucrative as his regular practice. “It makes it all the more headscratching why more people aren’t doing this a business,” he says. </p>


<p>Glenn Brooks, a New York-based anesthesiologist, began offering ketamine infusions for depression in 2012 after one of his sons committed suicide. “After he died, my wife and I did what most parents would do—scholarship funds, charity organizations, but it was never enough,” says Brooks. “A couple psychiatrists called and inquired whether I’d be interested in treating their patients for depression because they knew I was already using ketamine to treat patients with neuropathic pain--I thought, wow, this is exactly what I need to do.”</p>

<p>Brook’s New York Ketamine Infusions business is located in an office in Manhattan’s financial district, half of which he shares with a podiatrist. Since opening, he’s seen more than 600 depressed patients, many repeatedly. He charges $525 per infusion, but often ends up collecting less, based on his patients’ circumstances. “Nobody gets turn away, especially not if someone calls and is suicidal,” he says. </p>

<p>A workaholic by nature, Brooks shows up seven days a week, often spends 14 hours at the office, and takes off only Thanksgiving. “I go home, I ruin the turkey, and then everyone tells me to go back to work,” he jokes. “Typically I get ten calls and six to ten inquiries online from new patients each day…Patients come from all over, from as far away as Saudi Arabia.” Too busy to wade through his data, Brooks estimate that roughly 80 percent of his patients show miraculous improvement, especially those younger than 60. “For patients who are suicidal—and probably half of my patients are—they can get relief within an hour or two,” he says. “Patients who aren’t suicidal, it’s a little more subtle. It could be six to eight hours.” </p>

<p>Brooks scoffs at critics, many of them from pharmaceutical companies, who warn that we don’t yet know the longterm side effects of using ketamine and cite anecdotal evidence that the drug causes bladder problems. “I’ve been working with ketamine for 40 years—I know this drug better than I know my kids,” he says. Ketamine, he adds, has long been used repeatedly, at far higher doses, for pain management with no evidence of side effects.</p>

<p>For years now, Brooks has been mulling plans to train doctors and add new locations. “People are constantly asking me to open a center closer to them,” he says. Last year, he forged a partnership with a longtime ketamine researcher from Stony Brook School of Medicine and a Boston-based business group with expertise in running dental franchises, but he says it’s too early to discuss details. “I would think we’ll add a dozen in the next year or two,” he says. “I’m more of a humanitarian than a businessman, so hopefully these guys in Boston will save me from myself.”</p>

<p>Keith Ablow, who bills himself as “America’s most well-known psychiatrist,” and is known for expressing controversial opinions on Fox News, also has ambitious plans for growing a ketamine treatment empire. Instead of opening freestanding ketamine clinics, his fledgling company Neurogain hopes to raise $1 million this summer to start a network of “250 to 500” doctors who will offer ketamine treatments as a side business. “We believe we can double the salary of the average family physician or internist,” says Ablow. Neurogain, he explains, will keep up to 40 percent of the profits in exchange for providing training, marketing material, a portal through which doctors a can communicate, and a call center that will take care of billing and patient follow-up calls. </p>

<p>“There are millions and millions of depressed people who can benefit,” says Ablow. “The treatment runs about $3,000 for six IVs…We’re treating everyone from cashiers to CEOs because when you’re depressed, $3000…turns out not to be an impediment for people who have relatives who can help, health savings accounts, or who have a credit card they can draw on, for that matter.” </p>

<p>  Brooks, who nearly went into business with Ablow five years ago, worries that Ablow’s plan isn’t right for patients. “This is 24/7 stuff, not something you can do on the side,” he says. “Unless you can do this fulltime and keep up with the literature, with the paperwork, the demands, you’ll never understand these patients, you’ll never really know what you’re doing.” </p>

<p>Without regulation, many say the ketamine business is rife for missteps and exploitation. “Nobody in Florida knows what they’re doing,” says Brooks, by way of example. His assessment is based on a patient who got a ketamine infusion while on holiday. “It was a friggin’ disaster,” says Brooks. “The dose was too high, it was going in too fast, she started to get hysterical. Meanwhile, the doctor is calling me asking what to do.” Another doctor reportedly gave patients syringes with ketamine to take home and administer themselves. “The business model needs to be right,” says Brooks. “Safety comes first, efficacy second, and everything else follows.”  </p>

<p>Most ketamine advocates, including Brooks, are rooting for big pharma to develop an approved ketamine-like drug, even if it’s not ketamine proper. Some companies may be getting close. Johnson & Johnson is seeking approval for esketamine, a patented derivative of ketamine that’s roughly 20 percent more potent. The company this year plans to start phase three clinical trials for an esketamine nasal spray, which the FDA has given breakthrough therapy status. It may receive U.S. approval by 2018, says Mangi, who is spearheading the research. </p>

<p>J&J’s goal is to create a treatment that’s not just bankable but more convenient than intravenous ketamine. To make sure the drug isn’t abused, Mangi says patients will come to the doctor’s office two or three times a week and administer the spray there. “This is such a potentially revolutionary treatment, we don’t want to risk the possibility of something bad happening,” says Mangi. Both Mangi and Charney are patent holders for esketamineCK. </p>


<p>Illinois-based pharmaceutical company Naurex last year raised $80 million to perform phase three trails on a ketamine-like drug called GLYX-13, which they say won’t induce hallucinations. Privately held Baltimore company, Cerecor, is also developing a one-a-day pill that replicates ketamine’s effects. “I had one patient who came to me after being part of a Cerecor study and he said it was the best he’d ever felt,” says Brooks. </p>

<p>“I just wish the pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t badmouth ketamine [before there’s an alternative],” Brooks adds. “This drug is in every operating room, every intensive care unit.” </p>
